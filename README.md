<h1 align="center">MNTA</h1>

MNTA (minimalistic note-taking app) is a simple GTK app written in C that allows you to organize your notes, and interact with them all from your keyboard. It's configurable and simple.

<!-- TODO: add a demo video here... -->

## Configuration

By default, your `~/.config/mnta/config.json` will look like this:

```json
{
	"editor_launch_command":	"nvim",
	"background_color_hex":	"#171617",
	"keyboard_navigation_sensitivity":	25,
	"default_files_placement":	{
		"files_per_row":	5,
		"margin_horizontal":	300,
		"margin_vertical":	100,
		"container_padding":	50
	}
}
```

It should be pretty self-explanatory.
